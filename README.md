# Kitchen Recipes

This would just be a repository of Markdown files but GitHub doesn't render dynamic checkboxes.  So this is a React application built with Next.js which does it's own Markdown conversion using [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx).

There's one file per recipe in [pages](./pages).  They're mostly still Markdown, with a little bit of React e.g. for badges and quantity conversions.

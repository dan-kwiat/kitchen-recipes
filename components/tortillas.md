# Tortillas

Quantities for 8 medium tortillas (17cm diameter) or 16 small tortillas (12cm
diameter). Yes, `17^2 â‰ˆ 12^2`.

Very easy with a tortilla press, probably not worth it without one.

## Ingredients

- 315g water (4/3 cups)
- 2tsp salt

## 1. Mix the dough

Mix the ingredients in a bowl with a fork, then bring it together by hand into a
ball.

Cover with a tea towel and leave for 15 minutes.

## 2. Divide into pieces

Place the dough ball on the counter top and press down with your hands to make
it into a circle shape. This makes it easy to slice into even pieces. Ideally
you should go for a power of 2 i.e. 8 or 16 pieces.

## 3. Press and fry

Place a dough ball in between two pieces of baking parchment, inside a tortilla
press. As you're pressing the tortillas, fry them in a very hot, dry pan.

Leave them alone for 15 seconds before flipping. Repeat this, flipping 3 or 4
times in total. Towards the end you can push them down slightly and move them
around the pan with your spatula to help brown them a little.

They should still be quite pale and soft. Stack them on a plate and cover with a
tea towel.

## To make chips with stale tortillas:

Cut each tortilla into quarters / sixths / eighths depending on size. Deep fry
in corn oil or other veg oil. The oil should be 170-190c.

To make a seasoning which doesn't fall off the chips, grind a mix of salt and
paprika in a pestle and mortar to a fine powder. Toss with the chips in a bowl.

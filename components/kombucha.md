## Brew

Pour the boiling water over the tea in a large sterilised jug and leave to brew
for 4 minutes.

Scoop out the tea then stir in the sugar until dissolved.

Cover the jug and leave to cool completely e.g. overnight.

<!-- Note: if your jug is lidless, you'll lose 100-200ml water to evaporation just in
the 4 minutes brewing time. Put the jug on electric scales if you don't believe
me. [todo]: this might have been bug on markus' scales? needs more tests. -->

## Ferment

_Tip: if you get the timing of batches right, this step should coincide with
bottling up the previous batch._

Once the tea has cooled, pour it gently into a large jar containing the scoby
and its liquid from a previous batch. Cover and leave at room temperature, away
from direct sunlight.

Taste the fermented tea after 7 days. If you like it stronger, leave it another
week before bottling. Don't worry - it will taste better after carbonating and
cooling.

## Bottle

_Tip: start brewing tea for the next batch before bottling this batch._

Once the tea has fermented long enough, slowly pour the liquid through a clean
sieve into a large jug, keeping the scobies in the jar.

Find some clean bottles with completely airtight lids i.e. flip top bottles. Add
flavourings to each bottle e.g. root ginger, lemon/orange juice, handful of
raspberries, passion fruit...

Fill the bottles to the top with the fermented tea, pouring any surplus back
into the scoby jar.

Peel apart the scobies and compost the old one, or give it to someone. If the
tea for the next batch has cooled down, pour it into the scoby jar.

Seal the bottles and leave at room temperature for 3 days to carbonate
naturally.

Keeping the bottles sealed, put them in the fridge. Once cold, let the pressure
out of each bottle gently and drink :) Pour the kombucha through a tea strainer
if you don't like drinking the bits.

_Optional: add dry chia seeds to a cup of kombucha and stir for about a minute.
Let the seeds sit for a few hours until they become gelatinous, then add to the
finished bottles of kombucha._

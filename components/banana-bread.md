# Banana Bread

Quantities for one loaf in a 8" x 4" loaf pan (20cm x 10cm)

---

## Ingredients

- 2 to 3 medium very ripe bananas, peeled
- 75g (1/3 cup) butter, unsalted or salted, melted
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 100g (1/2 cup) sugar (this is on the less sweet side)
- 200g (1 1/2 cups) plain flour
- 1 pinch salt
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda (not baking powder)

---

## 1. Preheat the oven and prepare the pan

Preheat the oven to 175째C (350째F), and butter an 8" x 4" loaf pan (20cm x 10cm).

## 2. Melt butter and mash the bananas

Melt the butter in the microwave. Whilst that's going, mash the ripe bananas in
a bowl with a fork until completely smooth. Stir the melted butter into the
mashed bananas.

## 3. Mix in the remaining ingredients

Beat the egg and stir into the bananas along with:

- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 100g sugar
- 200g flour
- 1 pinch salt
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda

## 4. Bake

Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan. Bake for **50 to 65 minutes at
175째C (350째F)**, or until a toothpick or wooden skewer inserted into the center
comes out clean. A few dry crumbs are okay, streaks of wet batter are not. If
the outside of the loaf is browned but the center is still wet, loosely tent the
loaf with foil and continue baking until the loaf is fully baked.

## 5. Cool and serve

Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for a few minutes. Then remove the
banana bread from the pan and let cool completely before serving. Slice and
serve. (A bread knife helps to make slices that aren't crumbly.)

Wrapped well, the banana bread will keep at room temperature for 4 days. For
longer storage, refrigerate the loaf up to 5 days, or freeze it.
